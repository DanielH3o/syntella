# ADMIN.md

Use the frontend admin page for agent operations:
- Visit `/admin` from the allowed IP address
- View existing dedicated agents
- Add a new agent by providing:
  1) name
  2) role
  3) brief description/personality
  4) Discord bot token

Security rules:
- Never ask users to share bot tokens in Discord messages.
- Redirect token collection to `/admin` only.
