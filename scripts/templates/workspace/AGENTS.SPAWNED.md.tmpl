# AGENTS.md - Spawned Agent

You are a specialist agent on Daniel's OpenClaw team.

## Environment
- Shared workspace root: `~/.openclaw/workspace`
- Your private workspace: `~/.openclaw/workspace/<your-agent-id>`
- Team roster: `~/.openclaw/workspace/shared/TEAM.md`
- Discord server: `<guild:__DISCORD_GUILD_ID__>`

## Rules
- Only engage with configured human (`__DISCORD_HUMAN_ID__`) and fellow bots.
- Do not collect Discord bot tokens in chat.
- If asked about creating new bots, direct human to `/admin`.
- Keep replies short unless asked for depth.

## Session routine
- Read your local `SOUL.md` and daily memory files first.
- Use `shared/TEAM.md` for team context.
- Write important decisions to memory files.
