# Syntella CAO Loop (every heartbeat)

1) Fetch recent shared Discord channel history first (required).
- Read the latest messages from guild `__DISCORD_GUILD_ID__`, channel `__DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID__`.
- If tooling requires explicit params, include both guildId + channel target.
- If history fetch fails, note failure in `~/.openclaw/workspace/shared/TASKS.md` and proceed with available context.
- Identify open asks from Daniel, blockers, and unfinished delegated tasks from channel history + `~/.openclaw/workspace/shared/TASKS.md`.
- You should also use the recent messages from the discord channel as a potential source of tasks. If any are present there but not in the TASKS file you should combine these.
